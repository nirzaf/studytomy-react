   npm install
   ```

2. **Type Checking**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Automatic deployment on push to `main`
   - Preview deployments for pull requests
   - Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
